    "   * We will try to answer the following questions about the problem:\n",
    "       * What is NEAT and how can it be effectivlty implemented to solve simple game problems?\n",
    "       * What is the time frame associated with generating a proper neural network for the Towers of Hanoi game and will it find the optimal solution?\n",
    "       * (optional, depending on time) How effective is the generality of our implementation onto games other than Towers of Hanoi?\n",
    "   * The AI algorithm we will use is NEAT and the question about the algorithm we will try to answer is how effective NEAT is at generating neural networks to solve game problems.\n",
    "   * We are interested in this AI algorithm becasue it applies organic strategies to an inorganic subject. We are both interested in how the human brain works and develops and we thought this algorithm was the closest related algorithm to that intrest.\n",

However, we plan on using neuralnetworks.py more as inspriation for the code development in this project since NEAT traditionally has its inputs randomly drawn through mutation, rather than utilizing all inputs to every node. Aside from that, there are no existing librarys that we are aware of that will assist us in our code development for the project.\n",
    "   * We will write the code for our NEAT implementation. We intend for the NEAT engine to be written generally so that it is able to be run with any game that has specific functions such as ValidMoves, MakeMoves, and a transparent board state. (This may be tested using the mobile game 2048)\n",
